                        POLICY TERMS
                    </h1>

                    <p class="mt-6">
                        We provide a refund policy which is effective PRIOR to the submission
                        of your travel document application. By making a purchase of services
                        on this website, you agree and accept to be bound by the terms of this policy,
                        as well as the Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and any other applicable
                        policy or term posted on the site. Upon your review of the government
                        forms for submission after your purchase, your approval of these documents
                        will constitute waiver of your right to a refund from that point onwards.
                        Should a material error be made on your application, we will re-submit
                        the application on your behalf at no additional cost to you, but a
                        refund will NOT be issued.

                        NON-REFUNDABLE FEES
                    </h1>

                    <p>
                        Please note that this policy cannot and will not apply to government fees
                        remitted to the issuing authority, or other pertinent Governmental agencies.
                        When you send a payment to a government agency, you agree to pay for a government
                        service. Filing and biometric service fees that you pay to them are final
                        and non-refundable, regardless of any action the government office takes on
                        your application, petition, or request, or if you withdraw your request/application. We cannot
                        refund or credit any money paid to other third parties with a role in processing
                        your order (such as your medical examiner, translators, etc.).

                        CHARGEBACK NOTICE
                    </h1>

                    <p>
                        By obtaining our services, you agreed to be bound by the service terms and our refund policy.
                        Utilizing a chargeback to obtain a refund outside of these conditions is a violation of these terms.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We take this issue extremely seriously and may report suspicious payment disputes to both
                        the payment processors as well as the US Government’s issuing body, and other pertinent
                        agencies as applicable, along with accompanying proof of fraud. As chargeback fraud is
                        a crime, such conduct can result in being temporarily or permanently barred from entry
                        to the destination country, as well as result in possible criminal and civil charges.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We encourage our clients to contact us to resolve any service problems
                        they may have encountered, and to prevent any future issues.

                    <p>
                        We will exert every effort to provide you with the earliest available appointment
                        but cannot guarantee any outcome.  Note that US Embassy/Consular appointments
                        are under the full control of the Embassy/Consulate. Therefore, PL cannot alter
                        nor has any control over appointment availability at any time.

                    <p>
                        Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your government filing.
                        For example, the pertinent government agency may reject an immigration petition or
                        application for reasons outside the control or responsibility of our firm. Government
                        backlogs can also lead to long delays before your filing process is complete.

                    <p>
                        This guarantee does not cover changes to your situation or to your state of mind.
                        It does not apply if entry is denied by the Border Officer, due to an Epidemic/Pandemic
                        related reason. This Guarantee is void if you have made misrepresentations
                        on an application and/or provided misleading information during our service to you.
                        This Guarantee is void if you have already requested a refund or if you have
                        requested a chargeback from your bank.

                        Costs For Travel Documents

                    <p>
                        All travel document applicants are required to pay a visa fee to the US Government’s
                        issuing body. How much the application fee costs and when it must be paid,
                        always depends on the type of document applied for. Before you apply for a
                        travel document, you should therefore find out exactly which type of travel
                        document meets your traveling needs and which issuing authority charges the
                        processing fees for that document.

                    <h1 class="mt-6 font-bold text-lg">
                        Payment Methods
                    </h1>

                    <p>
                        The visa fee can be paid at U.S. consulates/Embassies worldwide through various options.
                        The following payment options are available:
                    </p>

                    <ul class="mt-6 list-disc">
                        <li>online bank transfers</li>
                        <li>debit card</li>
                        <li>credit card</li>
                        <li>immediate bank transfer</li>
                        <li>cash deposit with a bank</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="mt-6">
                        <strong>Note</strong>: In some countries (such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland) payment
                        <strong>cannot</strong> be made by credit card or girocard.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mt-6">
                        When paying, all instructions should be followed exactly so that the payment is
                        registered quickly. In particular, the reference number should always be noted
                        in the subject line, otherwise there may be delays in processing. In the worst case,
                        the visa fee may have to be paid again.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mt-6">
                        <strong>Practical tip</strong>: We strongly recommend the use of a credit card.
