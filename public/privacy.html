            <p class="mt-6">
              This Privacy Policy describes how your information is collected,
              used, and disclosed by Pemberton Law, PLLC (“PL”, “we,” “us,” or
              “our”) in connection with your use of our websites, and our
              services. The scope of this Privacy Policy covers both your use of
              any PL websites and any other ways in which you may interact with
              PL, such as when you speak to us on the phone or through a remote
              video call. It also describes the choices available to you
              regarding our use of your personal information. Information for
              California residents and individuals located in the European Union
              are also included within this policy. We reserve the right, at any
              time, to modify this Privacy Policy. If we make revisions that
              change the way we collect, use, or share personal information, we
              will post these changes in this Privacy Policy. You should review
              this Privacy Policy periodically so that you keep up to date on
              any changes to our policies.

            <p class="mt-6">
              We or our service providers may collect Personal Data and data
              that does not specifically identify you when you use our websites
              or services. In this section, we explain what types of Personal
              Information we may collect about consumers. The Personal
              Information collected depends on the type of interaction we have
              with a consumer (such as calling, or visiting our websites), the
              types of products a consumer considers or purchases, and what
              information PL customers choose to share with us. This section
              includes all the information that we may collect about consumers,
              but we will rarely collect all these types of information about
              any single individual. PL potentially collects the following
              categories of information about consumers, some of which may be
              collected or maintained in a manner such that it can be considered
              Personal Information:
            </p>

              <strong>Identifiers</strong>: Examples of the types of identifiers
              that PL may collect include real names, nicknames, postal
              addresses, online identifiers, Internet Protocol addresses (“IP
              addresses”), email addresses, account numbers, Social Security
              numbers, driver’s license numbers, passport numbers, and other
              government identification numbers.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-6">
              <strong>Other Types of Information</strong>: Examples of other
              types of information include physical characteristics or
              descriptions of you, telephone number, education, employment,
              financial information including bank account, credit card, and
              debit card numbers. It also includes additional information
              provided to PL directly by you, such as when you complete a
              questionnaire, answer a survey, or receive a consultation. This
              category includes information identified as Personal Information
              in California Civil Code Section 1798.80(e) that is not otherwise
              categorized.

              about the device the consumer is using to access our Websites or
              applications, and information regarding a consumer’s interaction
              with PL or our partners’ websites, applications, or
              advertisements. We may also collect information from visitors to
              our websites such as browser settings, operating systems,
              referring/exit pages, and clickstream data. When we send you an
              email, PL may also collect information, including about how you
              interact with that email.

              addition to obtaining your consent to process your Personal Data,
              we also may process such information to provide our services to
